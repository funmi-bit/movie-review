#This program utilizes some useful sematic elements and attribute to create a well structured and accessible web page. These semantic components helps to improve the code's accessibility, readability, and maintainability. They convey the content's organisation and meaning, which allows users and search engines to access the web content with ease, while also making it simpler for developers to understand and maintain the code.
The code is divided into different segments. Header, main and footer.  The header tag signifies the head of the page.  The main tag signifies body of the page which also has other semantic features such as sections and figure elements. Since the page consists of nine images with three images in a row, the section tag is used to divide these images in sections while figure tag is used to embed images inside it. Semantic attributes is also used in image tag. This is very useful for screen reader and other assistive technologies as disabled users will be able to understand the image when itâ€™s not available. 
Overall,  this programme enhances the quality of the web page, promotes a user-friendly experience, and makes it easier for developers to work together effectively. This is accomplished by effective utilisation of semantic features and attributes. The commitment to accessibility not only complies with inclusion guidelines, but also positions the website for the best possible search engine results.
